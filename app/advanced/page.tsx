          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Product Recommendations</h2>
          <p>
            Implement product recommendations by integrating your product database with the chatbot backend. Use natural language processing to understand user preferences and machine learning algorithms to suggest relevant products.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Payment Integrations</h2>
          <p>
            For secure payment processing, never handle payment information directly in the chatbot iframe. Use a secure, PCI-compliant payment gateway and redirect users to a secure payment page or open a new secure window for transactions.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Help Desk Connection</h2>
          <p>
            Connect the chatbot with a help desk by integrating your help desk API with the chatbot backend. Implement a handover protocol for when a human agent is needed and use websockets or long-polling for real-time communication.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Analytics and Reporting</h2>
          <p>
            Implement analytics in your chatbot backend to track user interactions, popular questions, and conversion rates. Use this data to continuously improve the chatbot's responses and effectiveness.
